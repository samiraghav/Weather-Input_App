# Weather-Input_App
This is a simple weather application that allows users to input their location and retrieve current weather conditions for that location. The application utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to gather weather data for the inputted location.

Getting Started
To get started with the application, simply clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/samiraghav/Weather-Input_App.git

Next, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using the following command:
npm install

You will also need to obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap to use the application. Once you have obtained an API key, create a .env file in the project directory and add the following line, replacing YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key:
REACT_APP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY

Finally, you can start the application using the following command:
npm start

The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000/.

# Usage
To use the application, simply enter a location into the input field and press the "Get Weather" button. The application will retrieve the current weather conditions for the inputted location and display them on the screen.
